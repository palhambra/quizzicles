## Description

This week's project was to create a quiz from scratch using JavaScript. When pressing the "Start Quiz" button, the page will hide the start menu and display the questions. Then after each question is answered, a result will pop up if you were right or wrong, along with the next set of questions. After all questions were answered, you will type in your initals and your score will be saved to a "High Score List", which you are able to clear.
